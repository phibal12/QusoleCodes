⊚ Objectives:
1. Present a universal scalar and metric to measure system parameters, based on their values. Each value
represents a physical phenomenon, e.g., quantum entanglement, symmetry, symmetry breaking [24],
superposition, or any statistical/mechanical event (quantum or classical) in the system.
2. Present information on the system in form of a QF-LC simulator (QF-LCS) to measure input states and
output states within this system, e.g., BEC. For example, distinguish energy states from one another in
a thermodynamic system by QF-LCA profiling them upon EE measurements.
3. Project efficient energy paths after their state classification. Map energy paths with/without quantum AI
(QAI), evaluate and validate states for a strong prediction of the next system state. Achieve the target

<div class="sdg-wheel" style="position: absolute; left: 360px; top: 120px" data-wheel-height="200" data-model="elsevier-sdg-multi" data-text="This dissertation presents detailed topics on Quantum Field Lens Coding (QF-LC) and Thermodynamic Metrics. There had been no research on QF-LC and its thermodynamic metrics prior to the present
work. QF-LC is presented as a project with research elements in form of peer-reviewed publications.
The QF-LC project comprises of 1- the quantum double-field (QDF) model, 2- QDF model’s code as
the QF-LC algorithm (QF-LCA), 3- application software as the QF-LC simulator (QF-LCS), simulating
a QDF system with its, 4- QF-LCA/QDF dataset. This project is developing alongside other quantum
models that employ quantum technologies in thermodynamic systems, with societal and global impacts.
QF-LCA, is a QF lens distance-based algorithm implemented on N-qubit machines. This algorithm
can be trained to make strong predictions on a system’s phase transition, as the aim of the QDF model and its QF-LC code. In a QDF-based system, QDF transformations are simulated by a DF computation (DFC) model to simulate systems as QF-LCS. QDF data are collected and analyzed to represent energy states, state transition (ST), and determine entanglement based on entanglement entropy (EE).
QF-LCS generates QDF datasets by its algorithm, the QF-LCA. QF-LCS, is useful for simulating systems and predict system events with high probability based on the QDF model, as evaluated in the published articles. The QF-LCS program analyzes the measurement outcome probability P data from
datasets generated by QDF circuits. Datasets are compared between the excited and ground states (ES and GS), as a P indicator generated for measurement samples. Small dataset samples denote:
a. A particle pair’s energy state |ij> superposing between QDF points (sublevels of a GS),
b. a single field (SF or particle state), an ES relative to a GS (a.), prior to its transform into a QDF,
c. the expected transformation of fields (ES <--> GS) and their expected P|ij> value.
A strong system state prediction is achieved by computing QF lens distance-based variables associated
to ST P’s from a QDF dataset. For this, a simulated QDF heat engine predicts thermal events by a QDF
lens function that (de-)focuses the distribution of energy states via QF lenses, which encode the system
state and produce the dataset. From this dataset, the energy path of the unfocused distribution of states is determined via particle entanglement measure. The energy path can be rerouted by focusing its distribution through QF lenses. In this heat engine, a QDF circuit samples particles and counts entangled qubit pairs.
An ST probability space doubles in prediction at the decoding step, e.g., P|ij> ≥ 1/3 into P|ij> ≥ 2/3
via (a.)–(c.), as SF to QDF. Field scalar kappa, scales a particle’s QF during interactions or diffusion of a
GS matter in the system. The dataset can be used to train QF-LCA via quantum AI (QAI). The trained
QF-LCA predicts and suggests an efficient energy path to choose by the QF-LCA user.
QF-LCA's classification of EE values, distinguishes entangled states in the system. Particles not reaching a desired energy state (a target state, or TS) by observing a GS/ES P outcome at the decoding step,
can be rerouted by the engine for a TS outcome. This generates a GS/ES energy profile to access and classify states by a classifier. The profile's data points (qubits), are inverse distance-based and labelled for
a specific class. After learning the profile, the classifier decodes and predicts the next system state.
A QDF game 'Alice and Bob’s Quantum Doubles,' is developed to validate the dataset as the P|ij>'s map
for a classical/quantum prediction where the P|ij>'s and the user's P's correlate in their value difference,
∆P. Dataset validation results are mapped to an intelligent decision simulator (IDS), as a QAI map. This
maximizes system efficiency on a TS via EE of energy states (distributed in the system).
QF-LCA applications are in data science, security, forensics, particle physics, etc., such as retrieving
or reconstructing information by distinguishing particle states from an evidence sample. Examples are,
reconstruct damaged DNA strands of cells to predict a virus’s TS, or cancer cell, its spread and growth
against healthy cells, identify forged documents from genuine based on QDF’s P|ij> values, and so on"></div>

<div class="sdg-wheel" data-wheel-height="200" style="position: absolute; left: 660px; top: 120px" data-model="aurora-sdg-multi" data-text="Life on Earth can be impacted (±) by outside influence, from nature, or inside influence, from humans. The impact is positive (+), if life is e.g., preserved, reconstructed, and/or replicated; otherwise, the impact is negative (−), if life is e.g., deteriorated, destroyed, and/or extinct. To detect what might happen as an event, a surveillance model needs to classify events and the emerging risks from them, prior to occurrence [12]. The event(s) data require an intelligence model to survey the potential
macro factors from the micro (or, quantum scale) observation of world events. These data are collected from world event databases (DBs), e.g., NASA, USGS, UNCTAD, CERN, and publications via software program runs
on local machines communicating with super (quantum) computers. These computers combine quantum computing with classical high-performance computing to solve complex problems as a hybrid machine. Data classification, analysis and testing processes of event-based DBs, are done via HCI’s end-user applications, e.g., quantum AI (QAI) engines for user queries. A secured hybrid architecture with a QAI probability map, can enhance the dataset analysis process, its probabilities, and make strong event predictions to achieve the desired target state (TS), micro-/macro-state, after simulation (lab) trials, as the user’s (or society’s) targeted outcome.
Education: Verification and validation of syllabi, teaching protocols and responses upon free thinking, debate and information exchange between students and teachers against †MDM spread across educational institutions. This also concerns public health standards for examining evidence in healthcare and medicine, see Category 4. 
Political: Predict and prevent cyberattacks and MDM via quantum resistant cybersecurity algorithms e.g., against the geopolitical and socioeconomics of a country’s political system.
See legal category which outlines how to avoid MDM and/or contradictory statements from a political member on policy via social media. This pertains to global economic threats concerning the effects of †MDM where QDF model
application can be of assistance to determine and classify these effects from actual information useful to societies. Nation-state leaders can be carriers/propagators of MDM if not taken seriously by societies. 
Thus, assessing leaders that exhibit certain mental disorders, like narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) [32], subject to SDGs 3, 16 and 17 for maintaining reliable nation states in global partnerships, becomes crucial.  

Technological: Develop more intelligent simulation models to simulate any thermodynamic system on any scale, and make strong system event predictions. IDS systems to save human lives and avoid disasters. 

Health: QDF model as a QFCM can be used to predict virus attacks and prevent its spread, or cancer treatment. Bradford Hill's 9 criteria for cause and effect can be compared and measured for consistency, with other 8 factors for an IDS. 

Economic: Employ the QDF model from e.g., in condensed matter physics using nano-/macro 3D printer, and its AI program to: predict and prevent cyberattacks, forgeries, MDM, theft, and promote clean energy economy by accurate climate forecasting. Replicate quantum states from QDF, or matter from quantum/matter source to guarantee food, medical, health, building/home security as a societal impact for new jobs, sustainable income, homes and cities for people of any class (SDGs 1-3, 79). Make strong predictions on Global Markets to avoid geoeconomic conflicts while transition to a clean energy economy occurs.

prevent costly outcomes e.g., Russia’s war on Ukraine costs [39].
• 3, 16: Construct datasets on politicians to determine what drives/hinders
political participation. Which politician has e.g., NPD and shifts from
civil duties to self-interest, unaccountability, and promote social and geopo-
litical (see previous example) vulnerabilities [32], once in office? Present
correlation and EE measures with ⟨⟩ outcomes between their QDF-based
psychological datasets [2–9,11].
• 3, 17: Predict/prevent cyberattacks made to political leaders via social me-
dia, email systems, etc. [43, c].
• 3, 16, 17: Enhance election security and integrity against cyberattacks and
human error, via a QDF hybrid security model by utilizing [4,20] methods.
• 16, 17: Check claims against MDM from political actors/ polls/media re-
altime to [maintain trust and integrity]★ by supplying evidence-based in-
formation to public.
• 3, 4, 17: Like cigarette packs have pictures of harm printed on them to warn
the consumer of the product of its use, label MDM by media detected via
UQFCM with a disclaimer for what it is as its consumer’s choice to accept
or reject that information. This ensures quality education, mental health and
well-being, regardless of the consumer’s location and background against
MDM
9, 16: [Build hybrid QDF human assisted self-driving vehicles]★ vs.
human/machine-based error/accidents [4,19].
• 3, 15: IDS in medical support and other fields in need of [saving lives]★ [4,
Sec. 1.1.3].
• 15, 16: [Achieve sustainable climate and environment]★ by predicting and
preventing worst-case scenarios e.g., biodiversity loss, then make decisions
against human-based disaster trigger points on Earth [12].
• 9, 11–13, 15, 17: Predict and [project shortest and efficient paths]★
to the user on an event map of e.g., earthquakes, wildfires, tsunami,
hurricanes, meteorites, etc. for a safe and secure transportation, see [15].
• 6: [Prevent virus spread or cancer cell growth]★ by creating QF shields
around healthy cells through quantum entanglement. Result is, administer reliable treatments in strengthening the immune system against cancer,
bacterial, and virus attacks [4, Secs. 1.1.3 and 1.2].
• 3: [Maintain and monitor mental and biological health]★ by guaranteeing
SDGs 1–3 examples from Categories # 1–3. This requires the examination
of the cause and effect evidence based on the Bradford Hill’s 9 criteria [22]"></div>
