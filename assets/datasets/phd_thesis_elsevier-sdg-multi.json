There had been no research on QF-LC and its thermodynamic metrics prior to the present work. QF-LC is presented as a project with research elements in form of peer-reviewed publications.\nThe QF-LC project comprises of 1- the quantum double-field (QDF) model, 2- QDF model\u2019s code as\nthe QF-LC algorithm (QF-LCA), 3- application software as the QF-LC simulator (QF-LCS), simulating\na QDF system with its, 4- QF-LCA/QDF dataset. This project is developing alongside other quantum\nmodels that employ quantum technologies in thermodynamic systems, with societal and global impacts.\nQF-LCA, is a QF lens distance-based algorithm implemented on N-qubit machines. This algorithm\ncan be trained to make strong predictions on a system\u2019s phase transition, as the aim of the QDF model and its QF-LC code. In a QDF-based system, QDF transformations are simulated by a DF computation (DFC) model to simulate systems as QF-LCS. QDF data are collected and analyzed to represent energy states, state transition (ST), and determine entanglement based on entanglement entropy (EE).\nQF-LCS generates QDF datasets by its algorithm, the QF-LCA. QF-LCS, is useful for simulating systems and predict system events with high probability based on the QDF model, as evaluated in the published articles. The QF-LCS program analyzes the measurement outcome probability P data from\ndatasets generated by QDF circuits. Datasets are compared between the excited and ground states (ES and GS), as a P indicator generated for measurement samples. Small dataset samples denote:\na. A particle pair\u2019s energy state |ij> superposing between QDF points (sublevels of a GS),\nb. a single field (SF or particle state), an ES relative to a GS (a.), prior to its transform into a QDF,\nc. the expected transformation of fields (ES <--> GS) and their expected P|ij> value.\nA strong system state prediction is achieved by computing QF lens distance-based variables associated\nto ST P\u2019s from a QDF dataset. For this, a simulated QDF heat engine predicts thermal events by a QDF\nlens function that (de-)focuses the distribution of energy states via QF lenses, which encode the system\nstate and produce the dataset. From this dataset, the energy path of the unfocused distribution of states is determined via particle entanglement measure. The energy path can be rerouted by focusing its distribution through QF lenses. In this heat engine, a QDF circuit samples particles and counts entangled qubit pairs.\nAn ST probability space doubles in prediction at the decoding step, e.g., P|ij> \u2265 1/3 into P|ij> \u2265 2/3\nvia (a.)\u2013(c.), as SF to QDF. Field scalar kappa, scales a particle\u2019s QF during interactions or diffusion of a GS matter in the system. The dataset can be used to train QF-LCA via quantum AI (QAI). The trained\nQF-LCA predicts and suggests an efficient energy path to choose by the QF-LCA user.\n", "model": "elsevier-sdg-multi", "model_name": "Elsevier SDG classifier", "@context": {"sdg": "http://metadata.un.org/sdg/", "product": "https://schema.org/Product", "model": "https://schema.org/Model", "text": "https://schema.org/Text", "icon": "https://schema.org/thumbnail", "prediction": "https://schema.org/Float", "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#"}, "predictions": [{"prediction": 0.00943784229, "sdg": {"@type": "sdg", "id": "http://metadata.un.org/sdg/1", "label": "Goal 1", "code": "1", "name": "No poverty", "type": "Goal", "icon": "https://aurora-sdg-classifier.uni-due.de/resources/sdg_icon_1.png"}}, {"prediction": 0.00396880321, "sdg": {"@type": "sdg", "id": "http://metadata.un.org/sdg/2", "label": "Goal 2", "code": "2", "name": "Zero hunger", "type": "Goal", "icon": "https://aurora-sdg-classifier.uni-due.de/resources/sdg_icon_2.png"}}, {"prediction": 0.0284484569, "sdg": {"@type": "sdg", "id": "http://metadata.un.org/sdg/3", "label": "Goal 3", "code": "3", "name": "Good health and well-being", "type": "Goal", "icon": "https://aurora-sdg-classifier.uni-due.de/resources/sdg_icon_3.png"}}, {"prediction": 0.00892026629, "sdg": {"@type": "sdg", "id": "http://metadata.un.org/sdg/4", "label": "Goal 4", "code": "4", "name": "Quality Education", "type": "Goal", "icon": "https://aurora-sdg-classifier.uni-due.de/resources/sdg_icon_4.png"}}, {"prediction": 0.00306788203, "sdg": {"@type": "sdg", "id": "http://metadata.un.org/sdg/5", "label": "Goal 5", "code": "5", "name": "Gender equality", "type": "Goal", "icon": "https://aurora-sdg-classifier.uni-due.de/resources/sdg_icon_5.png"}}, {"prediction": 0.00639905641, "sdg": {"@type": "sdg", "id": "http://metadata.un.org/sdg/6", "label": "Goal 6", "code": "6", "name": "Clean water and sanitation", "type": "Goal", "icon": "https://aurora-sdg-classifier.uni-due.de/resources/sdg_icon_6.png"}}, {"prediction": 0.510770261, "sdg": {"@type": "sdg", "id": "http://metadata.un.org/sdg/7", "label": "Goal 7", "code": "7", "name": "Affordable and clean energy", "type": "Goal", "icon": "https://aurora-sdg-classifier.uni-due.de/resources/sdg_icon_7.png"}}, {"prediction": 0.0152083933, "sdg": {"@type": "sdg", "id": "http://metadata.un.org/sdg/8", "label": "Goal 8", "code": "8", "name": "Decent work and economic growth", "type": "Goal", "icon": "https://aurora-sdg-classifier.uni-due.de/resources/sdg_icon_8.png"}}, {"prediction": 0.244334966, "sdg": {"@type": "sdg", "id": "http://metadata.un.org/sdg/9", "label": "Goal 9", "code": "9", "name": "Industry, innovation and infrastructure", "type": "Goal", "icon": "https://aurora-sdg-classifier.uni-due.de/resources/sdg_icon_9.png"}}, {"prediction": 0.0264597926, "sdg": {"@type": "sdg", "id": "http://metadata.un.org/sdg/10", "label": "Goal 10", "code": "10", "name": "Reduced inequalities", "type": "Goal", "icon": "https://aurora-sdg-classifier.uni-due.de/resources/sdg_icon_10.png"}}, {"prediction": 0.0384189188, "sdg": {"@type": "sdg", "id": "http://metadata.un.org/sdg/11", "label": "Goal 11", "code": "11", "name": "Sustainable cities and communities", "type": "Goal", "icon": "https://aurora-sdg-classifier.uni-due.de/resources/sdg_icon_11.png"}}, {"prediction": 0.0563970469, "sdg": {"@type": "sdg", "id": "http://metadata.un.org/sdg/12", "label": "Goal 12", "code": "12", "name": "Responsible consumption and production", "type": "Goal", "icon": "https://aurora-sdg-classifier.uni-due.de/resources/sdg_icon_12.png"}}, {"prediction": 0.00736092916, "sdg": {"@type": "sdg", "id": "http://metadata.un.org/sdg/13", "label": "Goal 13", "code": "13", "name": "Climate action", "type": "Goal", "icon": "https://aurora-sdg-classifier.uni-due.de/resources/sdg_icon_13.png"}}, {"prediction": 0.0118223848, "sdg": {"@type": "sdg", "id": "http://metadata.un.org/sdg/14", "label": "Goal 14", "code": "14", "name": "Life below water", "type": "Goal", "icon": "https://aurora-sdg-classifier.uni-due.de/resources/sdg_icon_14.png"}}, {"prediction": 0.0157993641, "sdg": {"@type": "sdg", "id": "http://metadata.un.org/sdg/15", "label": "Goal 15", "code": "15", "name": "Life in Land", "type": "Goal", "icon": "https://aurora-sdg-classifier.uni-due.de/resources/sdg_icon_15.png"}}, {"prediction": 0.0131856538, "sdg": {"@type": "sdg", "id": "http://metadata.un.org/sdg/16", "label": "Goal 16", "code": "16", "name": "Peace, Justice and strong institutions", "type": "Goal", "icon": "https://aurora-sdg-classifier.uni-due.de/resources/sdg_icon_16.png"}}]}
