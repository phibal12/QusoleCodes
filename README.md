This repository contains the code for the Qusole (Quantum Social Lensing) CS (Code Simulator) as an addition (add-on) to the ongoing project of the Quantum Field Lens Coding algorithm, QFLCA (Quantum Field Lens Coding Algorithm).
The QFLCA project repositories are available at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/gf2s8jkdjf/3 and https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.9905505.v2, which include the code, project website documentation, and demo video files. The status of the current Qaunsole project is: "In Progress"

<kbd> ![1D QDF circuit](1D-qdf-circuit.gif) </kbd> 

The QFLCS program analyzes the measurement outcome probability ($\cal P$) data from datasets generated by Quantum Double-field (QDF) Circuits. The datasets are compared between ES and GS states as a $\cal P$ indicator generated for measurement samples. Small dataset samples denote:

- **a)** A particle pair’s energy state in a QDF (different GS states or sublevels of a GS, or see Sec. 3 of the published article), <br>
- **b)** a particle state in an SF, an ES relative to a GS from (a.), prior to its transform into a QDF, and, <br>
- **c)** the expected transformation of fields (ES $\longleftrightarrow$ GS) and their $⟨{\frak M}(\cal{P}, \psi_{ij})⟩$, as in Sec. 3 of the published article.

This repository's file structure is a sample mirror of the Mendeley repository file structure of v3+ at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/gf2s8jkdjf/3, but with a much smaller file size for efficient download and use of the QFLCA project's code without the documentation (website) and demo video files. Certain small updates have been made in the main python file uploaded on Code Ocean for minor debugging purposes at https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.9905505.v2 or [Code Ocean](https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.9905505.v2). 

* QFLCA project's code without the documentation (website) and demo video files can be found under the <code></code/root/lab/sim/QFLCC classifiers></code> directory in <code></code/root/lab/sim/QFLCC classifiers/docs></code> and <code></code/root/lab/sim/QFLCC classifiers/site></code> folders at https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.9905505.v2 or [Code Ocean](https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.9905505.v2).

* We recommend downloading the entire <code><root/...></code> directory according to the folder structure and run <code>[QAI-LCode_QFLCC.py]</code> in VSC with python latest packages installed for Windows OS (the QDF game is developed for Windows OS, yet parts of the code for sound and display can be rewritten for Linux OS), e.g. <code>"winsound"</code> package as a compatible option. Other packages are needed to be installed or code rewritten for <code>"sound"</code> and <code>"display"</code> compatibility under other operating systems.
* The <code>[QAI-LCode_QFLCC.py]</code> file has a Pygame GUI and other packages suited for local machine runs, rather than running this file on the [Code Ocean](https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.9905505.v2) platform which could take hours to compile and run a compatible program/game with packages. 
However, the <code>[QDF-LCode_IBMQ-2024-codable.py]</code> can be run here as the core of the simulation program simulating the QDF circuit. 
A short presentation explaining these points are given in the <code></site/assets/video></code> directory as the <code>[QAI-COcean-Demo.mp4]</code> file from [Code Ocean](https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.9905505.v2).

<div class="sdg-wheel" data-wheel-height="250" data-model="aurora-sdg-multi" data-text="Education: Verification and validation of
syllabi, teaching protocols and responses
upon free thinking, debate and informa-
tion exchange between students and teachers
against †MDM spread across educational in-
stitutions. This also concerns public health
standards for examining evidence in health-
care and medicine, see Category #4.
Political: Predict and prevent cyberattacks
and MDM via quantum resistant cybersecu-
rity algorithms e.g. [7, Chap.
4], against
the geopolitical and socioeconomics of a
country’s political system.
See legal cat-
egory which outlines how to avoid MDM
and/or contradictory statements from a polit-
ical member on policy via social media. This
pertains to global economic threats concern-
ing the effects of †MDM where QDF model
application can be of assistance to determine
and classify these effects from actual infor-
mation useful to societies. Nation-state lead-
ers can be carriers/propagators of MDM if
not taken seriously by societies. Thus, as-
sessing leaders that exhibit certain mental
disorders, like narcissistic personality disor-
der (NPD) [32], subject to SDGs 3, 16 and
17 for maintaining reliable nation states in
global partnerships, becomes crucial.
Technological:
Develop more intelligent
simulation models to simulate any thermody-
namic system on any scale, and make strong
system event predictions. ‡IDS systems [4,6,
7, 14, 15] to save human lives and avoid dis-
asters [12].
Health: QDF model as a QFCM can be used
to predict virus attacks and prevent its spread,
or cancer treatment. Bradford Hill’s 9 crite-
ria for cause and effect can be compared and
measured for consistency, with other 8 fac-
tors [22] for an IDS [4],
Economic: Employ the QDF model from
e.g., [4] in condensed matter physics us-
ing nano-/macro 3D printer, and its AI pro-
gram to: predict and prevent cyberattacks
[7, 37], forgeries [4], MDM, theft, and pro-
mote clean energy economy by accurate cli-
mate forecasting. Replicate quantum states
from QDF, or matter from quantum/matter
source to guarantee food, medical, health,
building/home security as a societal impact
for new jobs, sustainable income, homes and
cities for people of any class (SDGs 1–3, 7–
9). Make strong predictions on Global Mar-
kets to avoid geoeconomic conflicts while
transition to a clean energy economy occurs.
Environmental:
See climate forecasting,
simulation model and IDS within Categories
#2 and 3. Main focus: forecast events impact-
ing climate (inside and/or outside influence)
via UQFCM. This includes complementing
ID #5, by providing 3D printing solutions to
employ the QDF model for 3D printed homes
with minimal to zero environmental and cli-
mate impacts per house unit.
Legal: From Category #5, detect forgeries
of {passports, banknotes, valuables, certifi-
cates, evidence}. Reconstruction of damaged
evidence, e.g., damaged DNA from a crime
scene, as information retrieval and error cor-
rection methods. This prevents false state-
ments and MDM presented in courts and so-
cieties.
Societal:
See examples in economic and
multi-stakeholder partnerships to achieve 17
SDGs by 2030. Reaching Qusole’s TS has
a major impact on society in sustainable de-
velopment goal (SDG 17), involving govern-
ments, civil society and private sector and the
UN.
[Achieve food security]★
against Categories #3–
6 negative causers, for no poverty, and promote health using mat-
ter/DNA/state/event replication from source, Eq. (7). For example, from a
condensed matter source to a 3D printer, reconfigure molecules, after print-
ing replicated matter, as food, housing, etc. materials. Produce matter in
mass amounts via QDFs at zero-point energy levels and condensed matter
physical environments (vacuum space) [4].
• 7, 8, 11–13, 15: [Achieve a clean energy
Achieve a clean energy economy]★ using the QDF
model to record data, whereafter analysing the data, suggest efficient en-
ergy paths [2–7] in reducing pollutants and fossil fuel emissions produced,
and removed from the atmosphere (achieve net-zero emissions).
– Forecast QDF-based data points and aggregate verdicts [6] for compa-
nies from their transactions relative to their global market gains and
losses. Motivate companies with the Qusole application to benefit stake-
holders for a sustainable clean energy economy against losses [10].
– Automated systems’s power consumption is increasing from tasks and
queries e.g., ChatGPT [41]. Employ the QDF heat engine [5] to aggre-
gate and suggest efficient energy paths to the system/AI agents/bots [34]
and IDS users [2–7]. These systems become more efficient, affordable
and accessible for a clean energy economy [10].
[Reduce cyberattacks and cybercrime costs] worldwide from 15%
growth per year, against $10.5 trillion spent annually [37] by QDF hybrid
solutions [7, Sec. 4].
 1–3, 13: [Predict cyberattacks]★ caused by climate change targeting sup-
ply chains, infrastructure, etc., for an effective climate action via QFCM to
address projected damages from it. Build and analyze QDF datasets, and
other impacts listed in ID #5 pertaining to program-based QDF verdicts,
Sec. 3.1, generated on MDM in societies.
• 1–3, 11: Employ the QDF model for 3D printed houses, matter replication
from QFs [4], as exemplified in ID #5 on food security. This is a sustainable
solution to the environment with minimal negative impact from its bio-
degradable and recyclable energy and waste per house.
• 1–3, 7–9, 11–13, 15: [Reduce the global extinction’s 
 16, 17: QFCM in law/forensics [4]: [reconstruct damaged documents]★,
DNA evidence from a disaster/crime scene.
• 16, 17: Detect forged from genuine documents. Conduct the physical re-
construction of the evidence’s damaged sample via the QDF model’s Quad-
FOOD, Sec. 3.2, and replicate the whole evidence via micro-/nano-scale
3D printers. This is by predicting what was the actual fragments of the
lost information [4, Secs. 2 and 4]. See, Eq. (7).
[Publish validated information and MDM notices library/DBs]★,
for the IDS user active on social media educational and gaming platforms,
e.g., embedded prizes/ news within the game TS s, wins/losses, messages,
report on viewer comment options, etc. (Figs. 2–4).
– Release this report as the societal prognosis based on the 𝔍�QSole( ) function in achieving SDGs or TS s.
3, 4: [Explore knowledge platforms]★ for the advancement of education
by cyberattack and user-bot interaction monitoring algorithms via hybrid
QDF algorithms.
• 3, 4: [Construct a hybrid platform]★ via a hybrid QDF IDS for teachers
to interact with students against social media MDM causing harm, make
realtime corrections and avoid unreliable information sources for a healthy
education.
• 3, 4:
[Promote healthy education]★ by appending verified informa-
tion, full or relevant snippets as online libraries to syllabi, game lev-
els, experimental phases, etc.
as prizes or TSs for students to read
and apply in their studies or society.
This is after validating the up-
dated information for students’ knowledge-based systems in game events,
interactive virtual reality classes, and so on.
• 4, 17: [Present QDF hybrid IDSs]★ to students/teachers /researchers, to
validate information on new concepts, claims, theories, opinions, and es-
tablish objective evidence using regulated OAI [23,24,43] based on deter-
mining the relationship between causation and the observed effect evidence,
e.g., the Bradford Hill’s 9 criteria [22]
• 16, 17: Forecast events via UQFCM predicting co-existential conflicts,
as in nation-states and world war(s) due to the seduction of current
events, based on the MDM propagation on history, prophecies and maps
[13]. Predict and secure the prize (TS) from a state leader who wants to
possess, expand and revive old lost maps triggered by nation-states, so to
prevent costly outcomes e.g., Russia’s war on Ukraine costs [39].
• 3, 16: Construct datasets on politicians to determine what drives/hinders
political participation. Which politician has e.g., NPD and shifts from
civil duties to self-interest, unaccountability, and promote social and geopo-
litical (see previous example) vulnerabilities [32], once in office? Present
correlation and EE measures with ⟨⟩ outcomes between their QDF-based
psychological datasets [2–9,11].
• 3, 17: Predict/prevent cyberattacks made to political leaders via social me-
dia, email systems, etc. [43, c].
• 3, 16, 17: Enhance election security and integrity against cyberattacks and
human error, via a QDF hybrid security model by utilizing [4,20] methods.
• 16, 17: Check claims against MDM from political actors/ polls/media re-
altime to [maintain trust and integrity]★ by supplying evidence-based in-
formation to public.
• 3, 4, 17: Like cigarette packs have pictures of harm printed on them to warn
the consumer of the product of its use, label MDM by media detected via
UQFCM with a disclaimer for what it is as its consumer’s choice to accept
or reject that information. This ensures quality education, mental health and
well-being, regardless of the consumer’s location and background against
MDM
9, 16: [Build hybrid QDF human assisted self-driving vehicles]★ vs.
human/machine-based error/accidents [4,19].
• 3, 15: IDS in medical support and other fields in need of [saving lives]★ [4,
Sec. 1.1.3].
• 15, 16: [Achieve sustainable climate and environment]★ by predicting and
preventing worst-case scenarios e.g., biodiversity loss, then make decisions
against human-based disaster trigger points on Earth [12].
• 9, 11–13, 15, 17: Predict and [project shortest and efficient paths]★
to the user on an event map of e.g., earthquakes, wildfires, tsunami,
hurricanes, meteorites, etc. for a safe and secure transportation, see [15].
• 6: [Prevent virus spread or cancer cell growth]★ by creating QF shields
around healthy cells through quantum entanglement. Result is, administer reliable treatments in strengthening the immune system against cancer,
bacterial, and virus attacks [4, Secs. 1.1.3 and 1.2].
• 3: [Maintain and monitor mental and biological health]★ by guaranteeing
SDGs 1–3 examples from Categories # 1–3. This requires the examination
of the cause and effect evidence based on the Bradford Hill’s 9 criteria [22]"></div>
