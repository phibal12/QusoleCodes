syllabi, teaching protocols and responses
upon free thinking, debate and informa-
tion exchange between students and teachers
against †MDM spread across educational in-
stitutions. This also concerns public health
standards for examining evidence in health-
care and medicine, see Category #4.
Political: Predict and prevent cyberattacks
and MDM via quantum resistant cybersecu-
rity algorithms e.g. [7, Chap.
4], against
the geopolitical and socioeconomics of a
country’s political system.
See legal cat-
egory which outlines how to avoid MDM
and/or contradictory statements from a polit-
ical member on policy via social media. This
pertains to global economic threats concern-
ing the effects of †MDM where QDF model
application can be of assistance to determine
and classify these effects from actual infor-
mation useful to societies. Nation-state lead-
ers can be carriers/propagators of MDM if
not taken seriously by societies. Thus, as-
sessing leaders that exhibit certain mental
disorders, like narcissistic personality disor-
der (NPD) [32], subject to SDGs 3, 16 and
17 for maintaining reliable nation states in
global partnerships, becomes crucial.
Technological:
Develop more intelligent
simulation models to simulate any thermody-
namic system on any scale, and make strong
system event predictions. ‡IDS systems [4,6,
7, 14, 15] to save human lives and avoid dis-
asters [12].
Health: QDF model as a QFCM can be used
to predict virus attacks and prevent its spread,
or cancer treatment. Bradford Hill’s 9 crite-
ria for cause and effect can be compared and
measured for consistency, with other 8 fac-
tors [22] for an IDS [4],
Economic: Employ the QDF model from
e.g., [4] in condensed matter physics us-
ing nano-/macro 3D printer, and its AI pro-
gram to: predict and prevent cyberattacks
[7, 37], forgeries [4], MDM, theft, and pro-
mote clean energy economy by accurate cli-
mate forecasting. Replicate quantum states
from QDF, or matter from quantum/matter
source to guarantee food, medical, health,
building/home security as a societal impact
for new jobs, sustainable income, homes and
cities for people of any class (SDGs 1–3, 7–
9). Make strong predictions on Global Mar-
kets to avoid geoeconomic conflicts while
transition to a clean energy economy occurs.
Environmental:
See climate forecasting,
simulation model and IDS within Categories
#2 and 3. Main focus: forecast events impact-
ing climate (inside and/or outside influence)
via UQFCM. This includes complementing
ID #5, by providing 3D printing solutions to
employ the QDF model for 3D printed homes
with minimal to zero environmental and cli-
mate impacts per house unit.
Legal: From Category #5, detect forgeries
of {passports, banknotes, valuables, certifi-
cates, evidence}. Reconstruction of damaged
evidence, e.g., damaged DNA from a crime
scene, as information retrieval and error cor-
rection methods. This prevents false state-
ments and MDM presented in courts and so-
cieties.
Societal:
See examples in economic and
multi-stakeholder partnerships to achieve 17
SDGs by 2030. Reaching Qusole’s TS has
a major impact on society in sustainable de-
velopment goal (SDG 17), involving govern-
ments, civil society and private sector and the
UN.
[Achieve food security]★
against Categories #3–
6 negative causers, for no poverty, and promote health using mat-
ter/DNA/state/event replication from source, Eq. (7). For example, from a
condensed matter source to a 3D printer, reconfigure molecules, after print-
ing replicated matter, as food, housing, etc. materials. Produce matter in
mass amounts via QDFs at zero-point energy levels and condensed matter
physical environments (vacuum space) [4].
• 7, 8, 11–13, 15: [Achieve a clean energy
Achieve a clean energy economy]★ using the QDF
model to record data, whereafter analysing the data, suggest efficient en-
ergy paths [2–7] in reducing pollutants and fossil fuel emissions produced,
and removed from the atmosphere (achieve net-zero emissions).
– Forecast QDF-based data points and aggregate verdicts [6] for compa-
nies from their transactions relative to their global market gains and
losses. Motivate companies with the Qusole application to benefit stake-
holders for a sustainable clean energy economy against losses [10].
– Automated systems’s power consumption is increasing from tasks and
queries e.g., ChatGPT [41]. Employ the QDF heat engine [5] to aggre-
gate and suggest efficient energy paths to the system/AI agents/bots [34]
and IDS users [2–7]. These systems become more efficient, affordable
and accessible for a clean energy economy [10].
[Reduce cyberattacks and cybercrime costs] worldwide from 15%
growth per year, against $10.5 trillion spent annually [37] by QDF hybrid
solutions [7, Sec. 4].
 1–3, 13: [Predict cyberattacks]★ caused by climate change targeting sup-
ply chains, infrastructure, etc., for an effective climate action via QFCM to
address projected damages from it. Build and analyze QDF datasets, and
other impacts listed in ID #5 pertaining to program-based QDF verdicts,
Sec. 3.1, generated on MDM in societies.
• 1–3, 11: Employ the QDF model for 3D printed houses, matter replication
from QFs [4], as exemplified in ID #5 on food security. This is a sustainable
solution to the environment with minimal negative impact from its bio-
degradable and recyclable energy and waste per house.
• 1–3, 7–9, 11–13, 15: [Reduce the global extinction’s 
 16, 17: QFCM in law/forensics [4]: [reconstruct damaged documents]★,
DNA evidence from a disaster/crime scene.
• 16, 17: Detect forged from genuine documents. Conduct the physical re-
construction of the evidence’s damaged sample via the QDF model’s Quad-
FOOD, Sec. 3.2, and replicate the whole evidence via micro-/nano-scale
3D printers. This is by predicting what was the actual fragments of the
lost information [4, Secs. 2 and 4]. See, Eq. (7).
[Publish validated information and MDM notices library/DBs]★,
for the IDS user active on social media educational and gaming platforms,
e.g., embedded prizes/ news within the game TS s, wins/losses, messages,
report on viewer comment options, etc. (Figs. 2–4).
– Release this report as the societal prognosis based on the 𝔍�QSole( ) function in achieving SDGs or TS s.
3, 4: [Explore knowledge platforms]★ for the advancement of education
by cyberattack and user-bot interaction monitoring algorithms via hybrid
QDF algorithms.
• 3, 4: [Construct a hybrid platform]★ via a hybrid QDF IDS for teachers
to interact with students against social media MDM causing harm, make
realtime corrections and avoid unreliable information sources for a healthy
education.
• 3, 4:
[Promote healthy education]★ by appending verified informa-
tion, full or relevant snippets as online libraries to syllabi, game lev-
els, experimental phases, etc.
as prizes or TSs for students to read
and apply in their studies or society.
This is after validating the up-
dated information for students’ knowledge-based systems in game events,
interactive virtual reality classes, and so on.
• 4, 17: [Present QDF hybrid IDSs]★ to students/teachers /researchers, to
validate information on new concepts, claims, theories, opinions, and es-
tablish objective evidence using regulated OAI [23,24,43] based on deter-
mining the relationship between causation and the observed effect evidence,
e.g., the Bradford Hill’s 9 criteria [22]
• 16, 17: Forecast events via UQFCM predicting co-existential conflicts,
as in nation-states and world war(s) due to the seduction of current
events, based on the MDM propagation on history, prophecies and maps
[13]. Predict and secure the prize (TS) from a state leader who wants to
possess, expand and revive old lost maps triggered by nation-states, so to
prevent costly outcomes e.g., Russia’s war on Ukraine costs [39].
• 3, 16: Construct datasets on politicians to determine what drives/hinders
political participation. Which politician has e.g., NPD and shifts from
civil duties to self-interest, unaccountability, and promote social and geopo-
litical (see previous example) vulnerabilities [32], once in office? Present
correlation and EE measures with ⟨⟩ outcomes between their QDF-based
psychological datasets [2–9,11].
• 3, 17: Predict/prevent cyberattacks made to political leaders via social me-
dia, email systems, etc. [43, c].
• 3, 16, 17: Enhance election security and integrity against cyberattacks and
human error, via a QDF hybrid security model by utilizing [4,20] methods.
• 16, 17: Check claims against MDM from political actors/ polls/media re-
altime to [maintain trust and integrity]★ by supplying evidence-based in-
formation to public.
• 3, 4, 17: Like cigarette packs have pictures of harm printed on them to warn
the consumer of the product of its use, label MDM by media detected via
UQFCM with a disclaimer for what it is as its consumer’s choice to accept
or reject that information. This ensures quality education, mental health and
well-being, regardless of the consumer’s location and background against
MDM
9, 16: [Build hybrid QDF human assisted self-driving vehicles]★ vs.
human/machine-based error/accidents [4,19].
• 3, 15: IDS in medical support and other fields in need of [saving lives]★ [4,
Sec. 1.1.3].
• 15, 16: [Achieve sustainable climate and environment]★ by predicting and
preventing worst-case scenarios e.g., biodiversity loss, then make decisions
against human-based disaster trigger points on Earth [12].
• 9, 11–13, 15, 17: Predict and [project shortest and efficient paths]★
to the user on an event map of e.g., earthquakes, wildfires, tsunami,
hurricanes, meteorites, etc. for a safe and secure transportation, see [15].
• 6: [Prevent virus spread or cancer cell growth]★ by creating QF shields
around healthy cells through quantum entanglement. Result is, administer reliable treatments in strengthening the immune system against cancer,
bacterial, and virus attacks [4, Secs. 1.1.3 and 1.2].
• 3: [Maintain and monitor mental and biological health]★ by guaranteeing
SDGs 1–3 examples from Categories # 1–3. This requires the examination
of the cause and effect evidence based on the Bradford Hill’s 9 criteria [22]"></div>
