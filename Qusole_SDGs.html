<div class="sdg-wheel" style="position: absolute; left: 60px; top: 120px" data-wheel-height="250" data-model="elsevier-sdg-multi" data-text="This dissertation presents detailed topics on Quantum Field Lens Coding (QF-LC) and Thermody-
namic Metrics. There had been no research on QF-LC and its thermodynamic metrics prior to the present
work. QF-LC is presented as a project with research elements in form of peer-reviewed publications.
The QF-LC project comprises of 1- the quantum double-field (QDF) model, 2- QDF model’s code as
the QF-LC algorithm (QF-LCA), 3- application software as the QF-LC simulator (QF-LCS), simulating
a QDF system with its, 4- QF-LCA/QDF dataset. This project is developing alongside other quantum
models that employ quantum technologies in thermodynamic systems, with societal and global impacts.
QF-LCA, is a QF lens distance-based algorithm implemented on N-qubit machines. This algorithm
can be trained to make strong predictions on a system’s phase transition, as the aim of the QDF model and
its QF-LC code. In a QDF-based system, QDF transformations are simulated by a DF computation (DFC)
model to simulate systems as QF-LCS. QDF data are collected and analyzed to represent energy states,
state transition (ST), and determine entanglement based on entanglement entropy (EE).
QF-LCS generates QDF datasets by its algorithm, the QF-LCA. QF-LCS, is useful for simulating
systems and predict system events with high probability based on the QDF model, as evaluated in the
published articles. The QF-LCS program analyzes the measurement outcome probability P data from
datasets generated by QDF circuits. Datasets are compared between the excited and ground states (ES and
GS), as a P indicator generated for measurement samples. Small dataset samples denote:
a. A particle pair’s energy state |ij⟩ superposing between QDF points (sublevels of a GS),
b. a single field (SF or particle state), an ES relative to a GS (a.), prior to its transform into a QDF,
c. the expected transformation of fields (ES ←→ GS) and their expected P|ij⟩ value.
A strong system state prediction is achieved by computing QF lens distance-based variables associated
to ST P’s from a QDF dataset. For this, a simulated QDF heat engine predicts thermal events by a QDF
lens function that (de-)focuses the distribution of energy states via QF lenses, which encode the system
state and produce the dataset. From this dataset, the energy path of the unfocused distribution of states is determined via particle entanglement measure. The energy path can be rerouted by focusing its distribution
through QF lenses. In this heat engine, a QDF circuit samples particles and counts entangled qubit pairs.
An ST probability space doubles in prediction at the decoding step, e.g., P|ij⟩ ≥ 1/3 into P|ij⟩ ≥ 2/3
via (a.)–(c.), as SFκ−→ QDF. Field scalar κ, scales a particle’s QF during interactions or diffusion of a
GS matter in the system. The dataset can be used to train QF-LCA via quantum AI (QAI). The trained
QF-LCA predicts and suggests an efficient energy path to choose by the QF-LCA user.
QF-LCA’s classification of EE values, distinguishes entangled states in the system. Particles not reaching a desired energy state (a target state, or TS) by observing a GS/ES P outcome at the decoding step,
can be rerouted by the engine for a TS outcome. This generates a GS/ES energy profile to access and
classify states by a classifier. The profile’s data points (qubits), are inverse distance-based and labelled for
a specific class. After learning the profile, the classifier decodes and predicts the next system state.
A QDF game “Alice & Bob’s Quantum Doubles,” is developed to validate the dataset as the P|ij⟩’s map
for a classical/quantum prediction where the P|ij⟩’s and the user’s P’s correlate in their value difference,
∆P. Dataset validation results are mapped to an intelligent decision simulator (IDS), as a QAI map. This
maximizes system efficiency on a TS via EE of energy states (distributed in the system).
QF-LCA applications are in data science, security, forensics, particle physics, etc., such as retrieving
or reconstructing information by distinguishing particle states from an evidence sample. Examples are,
reconstruct damaged DNA strands of cells to predict a virus’s TS, or cancer cell, its spread and growth
against healthy cells, identify forged documents from genuine based on QDF’s P|ij⟩ values, and so on."></div>

<div class="sdg-wheel" data-wheel-height="250" style="position: absolute; left: 360px; top: 120px" data-model="aurora-sdg-multi" data-text="Life on Earth can be impacted (±) by outside influence, from nature, or inside influence, from humans. The impact is positive (+), if life is e.g., preserved, reconstructed, and/or replicated; otherwise, the impact is negative (−), if life is e.g., deteriorated, destroyed, and/or extinct. To detect what might happen as an event, a surveillance model needs to classify events and the emerging risks from them, prior to occurrence [12]. The event(s) data require an intelligence model to survey the potential
macro factors from the micro (or, quantum scale) observation of
world events. These data are collected from world event databases
(DBs), e.g., NASA, USGS, UNCTAD, CERN, and publications via software program runs
on local machines communicating with super (quantum) computers. These computers combine quantum computing with classical high-performance computing to solve complex problems
as a hybrid machine. Data classification, analysis and testing processes of event-based DBs, are done via HCI’s end-user applications, e.g., quantum AI (QAI) engines for user queries.
A secured hybrid architecture with a QAI probability map, can enhance the dataset analysis process, its probabilities, and make strong event predictions to achieve the desired target state (TS), micro-/macro-state, after simulation (lab) trials, as the user’s (or society’s) targeted outcome.
